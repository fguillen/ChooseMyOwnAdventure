        <p>TEXT ABOUT THE PROJECT EXPLAINING A LITTLE BIT WHAT DO WE NEED AND MAYBE 
          THEORETICAL BASES</p>

        <p><span>1.</span> The concept of authorship. Is the artist the sole author of
          the work? In a moment of collaboration, meetings between technology and art 
          and the Internet as a background, it is essential to revise the traditional idea 
          of authorship.</p>

        <p><span>2.</span> The independence of the operator versus the dictates of the 
          market and the public. To what extent are independent as creators of the prevailing 
          fashions of the mandates of the public and market influences.</p>
        
        <p><span>3.</span> Hypertext as rhizome structure and combinatorics. Hypertext is a 
          vertical construction, synchronous and multiple mirror schizophrenic structure of 
          society. The readings are no longer horizontal and attention span is limited. The 
          idea of link as a constellation of concepts, the Internet as a platform for dissemination, 
          creation, interaction and exchange.</p>
        
        <p>Rhizome relations are extended and connected to the whole, with a world in 
          which to establish a logical sequence of "Y", the juxtaposition and dialogue 
          between the parties that are connected: Cross Movement, connection, palimpsest, 
          Hypertext: Rhizome. = I still havenâ€™t understood that completely? Maybe you can 
          say something to that? - But I also will keep investing into that.</p>

        <p><span>4.</span> The idea of submission, the submissive always carries out 
          the instructions of his master, but the latter is manipulated in exactly that 
          order through the other what the submissive wants to do.</p>

        <p><span>5.</span> The ability to embody the figure of a performer. Not only 
          actor of the idea, but an interpreter in a broad sense, resulting in part by 
          translating the suggestions of users of the web. = are actors not always 
          doing that? they integrate it in their own persona, interpret it? Can you 
          explain me once more what you mean?</p>

        <p><span>6.</span> The work of art. In developing the daily work and subject 
          to a timetable and a deadline, it generates a reflection on the artist as a
          worker. Goes every day to the post, setting out its proposals, analyzes them, 
          make them, the exhibits.</p>
